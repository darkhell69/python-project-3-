## üìå Project Summary ‚Äì Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset** to uncover insights about content availability, trends, and audience preferences. Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI/Tableau**, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and storytelling.

### üîç Key Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values (e.g., director, cast, release year).
   * Standardized date formats and extracted **year, month, and day** for trend analysis.
   * Created new columns such as **Content Type (Movie/TV Show)** and **Duration in minutes/seasons**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Distribution of **movies vs TV shows** on Netflix.
   * Top countries contributing maximum content (e.g., USA, India).
   * Trend of content addition over years (growth after 2015).
   * Most frequent **genres/categories** like Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries.
   * Popular directors/actors and their contribution.
   * Content rating distribution (TV-MA, PG, R, etc.).

3. **Visualization & Dashboard**

   * Built **interactive dashboard** showing:

     * Year-wise addition of titles.
     * Country-wise distribution (World Map visualization).
     * Genre popularity by count.
     * Top 10 actors and directors.
     * Content ratings breakdown.
   * Used slicers/filters for type, year, and genre to allow dynamic exploration.

4. **Insights & Business Impact**

   * Netflix has been **increasing its global content strategy**, with huge growth after 2015.
   * Movies dominate the platform, but **TV shows are rapidly growing** in recent years.
   * Strong presence in the **US & India**, showing key regional focus.
   * Content is shifting towards **adult audiences (TV-MA ratings)**.
   * Drama and International TV shows are among the most popular categories.
